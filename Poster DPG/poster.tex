    Literature suggests a phase-separated state. \cite{Linner23}
    \item Striped region: Inaccuracies due to finite discretization dominate; here the gap is of the same order of magnitude as our gap

\highlightOne{ Key ideas \cite{Kalthoff17,Bleicker18}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Objective: capture collective excitations
\item Consider a time-dependent operator $\hat{a}(t) = \sum_j c_j(t) \hat{A}_j$ and the symplectic product $(\hat{A} | \hat{B}) \coloneqq \langle [\hat{A}^\dagger, \hat{B}] \rangle$
\item Write the Heisenberg EoM as matrix-vector EoM (w.r.t. to full interaction Hamiltonian)
\begin{equation*}
    \label{eqn:heisenberg}
    \begin{aligned}
        \ddt \hat{a}(t) = \sum_j \ddt c_j(t) \hat{A}_j &= \im \sum_j c_j(t) [H, \hat{A}_j] \\
        \Rightarrow \sum_j \underbrace{(\hat{A}_i | \hat{A}_j)}_{\coloneqq \mN_{ij}} \ddt c_j(t) &= \im \sum_j \underbrace{(\hat{A}_i | [\hat{H}, \hat{A}_j])}_{\coloneqq \mM_{ij}} c_j(t) \\
        \Rightarrow \mN \ddt \vec{c}(t) &= \im \mM \vec{c}(t)\,.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\item Generalized eigenvalue problem $\omega \mN \vec{v} = \mM \vec{v}$, real solutions if either $\mM$ or $\mN$ is nonnegative.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\rightarrow$] $\mM$ is nonnegative is thermal equilibrium
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\highlightOne{ Green's functions }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Elements of the matrix $\greens{ } \coloneqq \mN [-(\omega + \im 0^+) \mN - \mM]^{-1} \mN$ are Fourier-transformed Green's functions
    \item Specifically
    \begin{equation*}
        \mathcal{G}_{ij}(\omega) = G_{\hat{A}_i \hat{A}_j^\dagger} (\omega) = -\im \int_0^{\infty} \langle [A_i(t), A_j^\dagger(0)] \rangle e^{\im (\omega + \im 0^+) t} \mathrm{d}t
    \end{equation*}
    \item The matrices $\mN$ and $\mM$, and therefore also $\mathcal{G}(\omega)$, exhibit a block structure
    \item Lengthy calculations yield a quadratic form for the two blocks, denoted $|_X$ and $|_P$
    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal{G}(z = \omega + \im 0^+) &= \mathcal{N} \frac{1}{-z \mN - \mM} \mathcal{N} \\
        \to \mathcal{G}|_X (z) = - \mathcal{L}^\dagger \check{N}_X^{-1/2} \frac{1}{z^2 - \check{M}_X} \check{N}_X^{-1/2} \mathcal{L}\,&,\qquad
        \mathcal{G}|_P (z) = - \mathcal{L} \check{N}_P^{-1/2} \frac{1}{z^2 - \check{M}_P} \check{N}_P^{-1/2} \mathcal{L}^\dagger
    \end{align*}
    \item Matrix inverse by tridiagonalization and subsequent continued fraction expansion with square-root terminator
