Title:  
Collective excitations in competing phases in two and three dimensions

Abstract:
We investigate the superconducting (SC), charge-density wave (CDW), and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) phases in the extended Hubbard model at zero temperature and half-filling. We employ
the iterated equations of motion approach to compute the two-particle Green’s functions and their
spectral densities. This renders a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of collective excitations
possible as the model’s parameters are changed across phase transitions. We identify the well-known
amplitude (Higgs) and phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) modes within the superconducting phase and
observe a similar excitation (Cooperon) in the CDW phase which shifts towards zero energy as the
system approaches the phase transition to the SC phase. In the CDW phase, close to the phase
transition to the AFM phase, we find a collective mode (exciton) that does not change significantly
and another mode (magnon) that moves into the two-particle continuum. In the AFM phase we
identify both longitudinal and transversal magnons.
