# List of things, that I believe to be interesting, but have not (yet) investigated

## Effect of dispersive phonons
Don't consider \omega(q) = \omega_D = const, but rather a real dispersion.
Must likely be restricted to momentum sums, i.e., 1D or 2D systems.

## Let the pair creation operators flow in the CUT as well
This would only change the operators entering the Green's functions, so I believe that this should not affect the occurring modes.
Yet, it might be interesting to check that.

## Dispersions of collective excitations
On 1D or 2D systems, compute and study the dispersions of the secondary modes.

## Multiband systems
Multiband (and multigap) systems exhibit another mode related to the phase difference between the two gaps.
See, how this is affected by the CUT interaction

## Difference between Lenz-Wegner, Fr√∂hlich, and our CUT approach
See what differences occur.
