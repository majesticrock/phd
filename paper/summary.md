Collective behavior as a precursor of phase transitions

In our study, we delved into the intricate collective behavior of 
condensed matter systems as they undergo phase transitions. 
We developed a versatile method to calculate so-called Green's 
functions that works even in higher dimension - a feat that 
is often difficult to achieve due to the necessary large number
of sampling points to be tracked in brute force approaches
relying on high dimensional discretizations. 
The Green's functions are essential for analyzing the dynamic 
properties of quantum systems. Our analysis 
involved identifying and studying various collective 
excitations and observing how they change across different 
phases. Specifically, we studied the behavior of 
superconducting phases and the corresponding modes. 
Additionally, we examined charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic phases 
and the corresponding modes, both of which represent important quantum 
phenomena with promising properties for material sciences. Our approach 
aligns automatically with the rigorous Goldstone's theorem, resulting in 
massless bosons whereever a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken.
