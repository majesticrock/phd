\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\textcolor{red}{Intro auf die Phasen und Anregungen beziehen, danach Theorie auspacken}
The Hubbard model has been studied in a plethora of previous studies. 
Early studies proved the existence of eigenstates to the Hubbard Hamiltonian that exhibit off-diagonal long-range order,
encouraging the model's usage for the description of high-temperature superconductivity \cite{yang89}.
Shortly afterward, an exact SO(4) symmetry was discovered,
which allows a degeneracy of superconductivity (SC) and a charge-density wave (CDW) governed by an attractive on-site interaction \cite{yang90}.
This coexistence can be argued by the existence of a particle-hole transformation on bipartite lattices, 
that maps the attractive Hubbard model exactly onto the repulsive one, exhibiting antiferromagnetism (AFM) \cite{Hirsch85}.
The previously mentioned SC and CDW phases map to different spin operators \cite{zitko15,lieb89}.

Numerous studies have been performed on equilibrium systems. 
These investigated the phases and various quantities therein of the said model including various additional interactions with and without doping 
\cite{Micnas88,Micnas88b,Micnas89,Dzierzawa92,Kostyrko92,Eriksson95,Staudt00,Onari04,Toschi05,Brackett16,Paki19,romer20,Sushchyev22}.
For a long time, works on the dynamics of the superconducting gap parameter focused on its behavior after an instantaneous quench, 
yielding damped or persistent oscillations depending on the magnitude of the quench \cite{Volkov73,Yuzbashyan05,Yuzbashyan06,Barankov06,Cui19}.
More recent experimental and theoretical studies examined the driven systems in the hope of inducing superconductivity \cite{Nicoletti14,Krull14,Moor14,Casandruc15,patel16,sentef17,Buenemann17}.

In this paper, we will restrict ourselves to the half-filled Hubbard model, including an additional intersite interaction, on a square and a simple cubic lattice.
\textcolor{red}{FÃ¼r den 3D Fall finde ich keine Phasendiagramme des extended Hubbard models, ggf nochmal suchen...}
The 2D case already exhibits a wide range of possible phases, including CDW, AFM as well as $s$- and $d_{x^2 - y^2}$-wave superconductivity
\cite{Micnas88b,Tsuchiura95,Su01,Su04,ha11,Huang13,Jiang22}.

In this article, we will first employ a mean-field approximation to the interaction terms 
and then use the methodology from the so-called iterated equations of motion approach (iEoM),
which has already seen success in the handling of interaction quenches \cite{uhrig09,hamerla13,hamerla14,bleicker18}.
Here, one commutes operators from a suitable operator basis with the Hamiltonian and adds the newly occurring terms to it.
Naturally, a truncation is necessary for most practical applications, however, the approximation becomes better the more terms are included within the basis.
The functionality of this method has been compared to the density matrix formalism and has proved to be considerably more accurate \cite{Kalthoff17}.
Additionally, we will show an explicit way to obtain various Green's functions from the aforementioned methodology.
By extension, we also obtain the spectral functions of the investigated systems and discuss the excitations found therein.
The prominent examples in the SC phase are the well-known phase (Leggett) and amplitude (Higgs) modes \cite{Varma02,Cea14,Measson14,Tsuji15,Krull16,Schwarz20,Fan22}.
The former is located at zero energy as our model describes neutral superfluids.
The latter is found at the lower edge of the two-particle continuum.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
In \autoref{sec:model} we will introduce the model and its Hamiltonian as well as our mean-field theory.
A brief overview of the iterated equations of motion approach is presented in \autoref{sec:ieom}.
Next, we show our results in \autoref{sec:results}.
Lastly, in \autoref{sec:conclusion}, we will discuss our results.
%In the appendix \textcolor{red}{(or in the supplemental material?)}, we will derive and explain our methods in detail.

\section{Model and mean-field theory}\label{sec:model}

\subsection{Model}

\textcolor{red}{Schreiben wie cool das Hubbard Model ist}

The Hamiltonian of the extended Hubbard model is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:full_hamiltonian}
    \begin{aligned}
        H = &-t \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle, \sigma} \left( c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{j\sigma} + \text{h.c.} \right) 
        + \mu \sum_{i,\sigma} n_{i\sigma} \\
        &+ U \sum_{i} n_{i\uparrow} n_{i\downarrow} 
        + \frac{V}{2} \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle, \sigma} n_{i\sigma} n_{j\sigma}\,,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $c_{i\sigma}^{(\dagger)}$ annihilates (creates) an electron with spin $\sigma$ on lattice site $i$ 
and $\langle i, j\rangle$ denotes the summation over the next neighbors.
The parameters are the hopping amplitude $t$, the onsite interaction $U$, the intersite interaction $V$, and the chemical potential $\mu$.
Applying a Fourier transform into $k$ space yields the single-particle dispersion 
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_0 (\vk) = -2t \sum_{\alpha=1}^D \cos(k_\alpha)\,,\quad k_\alpha \in [-\pi, \pi)\,,
\end{equation}
with the system's dimension $D$ and the dimensionless momentum $\vk$.

\subsection{Static mean-field theory}

Next, we decouple the interaction terms.
We define 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:operators}
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{k\sigma} &\coloneqq  c_{\vk\sigma}^\dagger c_{\vk\sigma}\,,      &f_k     &\coloneqq  c_{-\vk\down} c_{\vk\up}\,, \\
        g_{k\sigma} &\coloneqq  c_{\vk\sigma}^\dagger c_{\vk+\vQ\sigma}\,,  &\eta_k  &\coloneqq  c_{-\vk-\vQ\down} c_{\vk\up}\,,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vQ \coloneqq  (\pi, ...)$ defines the nesting vector for the CDW and AFM phases, see Ref. \cite{sentef17}.
We use the following abbreviations to write down the mean-field parameters
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \label{eqn:delta_cdw}
        \Delta_\text{CDW} &= \left(\frac{U}{2N} - \frac{zV}{N}\right) \sum_{\vk\sigma} \langle g_{\vk\sigma} \rangle\,, \\
        \label{eqn:delta_afm}
        \Delta_\text{AFM} &= \frac{U}{2N} \sum_{\vk} \left( \langle g_{k\uparrow} \rangle - \langle g_{\vk\downarrow} \rangle \right)\,, \\
        \Delta_\text{SC} &= \frac{U}{N} \sum_{\vk} \langle f_{\vk} \rangle\,, \\
        \Delta_\eta &= \frac{U}{N} \sum_{\vk} \langle \eta_{\vk} \rangle\,, \\
        \Delta_n &= \frac{V}{N} \sum_{\vk,\sigma} \sum_{\alpha=1}^D \cos k_\alpha \langle n_{\vk\sigma} \rangle\,,
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $z$ denotes the coordination number of the lattice.
The last parameter, $\Delta_n$, renormalizes the hopping term to
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon( \vk ) \coloneqq  -(2 + \Delta_n) \sum_{\alpha=1}^D \cos(k_\alpha)\,.
\end{equation}
In total, we obtain the mean-field Hamiltonian in spinor representation as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:mf_hamiltonian}
    H_\text{MF} = \sum_{\vk} \Psi^\dagger (\vk) h(\vk) \Psi (\vk)\,,
\end{equation}
with the spinors
\begin{equation}
    \Psi^\dagger (\vk) \coloneqq  \left( c_{\vk\up}^\dagger\,, c_{\kplusQ\up}^\dagger\,, c_{-\vk\down}\,, c_{\kminusQ\down} \right)
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    h(\vk) \coloneqq  \begin{pmatrix}
        \epsilon (\vk) & \Delta_-^* & \Delta_\text{SC} & \Delta_\eta \\
        \Delta_- & \epsilon (\vk + \vQ) & \Delta_\eta & \Delta_\text{SC} \\
        \Delta_\text{SC}^* & \Delta_\eta^* & - \epsilon (-\vk) & - \Delta_+ \\
        \Delta_\eta^* & \Delta_\text{SC}^* & - \Delta_+^* & - \epsilon (-\vk - \vQ)
        \end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{equation}
where we defined $\Delta_\pm \coloneqq \Delta_\text{CDW} \pm \Delta_\text{AFM}$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{plots/phase_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{The phase diagram obtained for the extended Hubbard model on 
    (a) a square lattice and (b) a simple cubic lattice using a mean-field approximation at temperature $T=0$.
    The CDW-AFM boundary lies at $U = zV$, where $z$ is the coordination number. 
    For $U<0$ and $V=0$, there is a coexistence of CDW and $s$-wave SC.
    The boundary for the $d_{x^2 - y^2}$-wave SC (dashed line) for the square lattice has been taken from Ref. \cite{Micnas88b}, 
    as it is not accessible using our formalism.}
    \label{fig:phase_diagram}
\end{figure}

We observe that the entire Hamiltonian and thus all expectation values only depend on
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\gamma}(\vk) \coloneqq \frac{1}{D} \sum_{\alpha=1}^D \cos(k_\alpha)\,,
\end{equation}
i.e., for any operator $\hat{O}$ the following relation holds 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:equal_expecs}
    \langle \hat{O}_{\vk} \rangle = \langle \hat{O}_{\vk'} \rangle \eqqcolon \langle \hat{O}( \gamma ) \rangle\,,
\end{equation}
if $\hat{\gamma}(\vk) = \hat{\gamma}(\vk')$.
While two-dimensional systems around the size of $100\times100$ lattice sites can still be solved by using momentum sums,
computing solutions for large three-dimensional systems becomes impossible due to the $N=L^3$ scaling.
This issue can be resolved by using the aforementioned fact and replacing the momentum sums with energy integrals using the bare density of states (DOS)
\begin{equation}
    \rho(\gamma) \coloneqq  \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\vk} \delta \left(\gamma - \hat{\gamma} (\vk) \right)\,.
\end{equation}
As an example, we consider 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_\text{SC} = \frac{U}{N} \int_{-1}^{1} \dgamma \rho(\gamma) \langle f( \gamma ) \rangle\,.
\end{equation}
We will be using the exact densities of states for the square and the simple cubic lattice found in Ref. \cite{Hanisch97}.
This allows us to access both two- and three-dimensional models on equal footing.
We can compute any phase as long as it does not introduce another kind of momentum dependence.

We solve the mean-field equations self-consistently.
The $\gamma$-integrals are approximated numerically using a $\tanh$-$\sinh$ quadrature \cite{takahasi73}, 
terminating once $|1 - \int \dgamma \rho(\gamma)| < 10^{-13}$ and reusing the computed points and weights.
This method excels at dealing with the singularities in the DOS, 
requiring merely a few hundred function evaluations to achieve the desired accuracy.

This procedure yields the ground state phase diagram at temperature $T=0$ shown in \autoref{fig:phase_diagram}.
The CDW-AFM boundary is located at $U = zV$, where $z$ is the coordination.
This holds for both the square lattice ($z=4$) and the simple cubic lattice ($z=6$) and can be seen by comparing \eqref{eqn:delta_cdw} and \eqref{eqn:delta_afm}:
Crossing the aforementioned line, changes which one of the two prefactors is larger.

Note, that the $d_{x^2 - y^2}$-superconducting state, which has been confirmed for the square lattice \cite{Micnas88b,Huang13}, cannot be described by our method. 
This is due to our restriction to terms that are proportional to $\hat{\gamma}(\vk)$.

\section{Iterated equations of motion and Green's functions}\label{sec:ieom}

So far we have discussed the static mean-field equations that essentially describe the static ground state.
These results will be used to compute the quantities, namely expectation values, necessary for the iterated equations of motion approach \cite{uhrig09,hamerla13,hamerla14,bleicker18}.
With it, we can describe two-particle quantities like the various collective excitations of the system.

We start with some operator set $\mathcal{B}$ that is complete with respect to commutation with a Hamiltonian $H$, 
i.e., any commutator $[H, A]$ for any $A \in \mathcal{B}$ can be represented by linear combinations of operators in $\mathcal{B}$.
We can then express any time-dependent operator from this set as
\begin{equation}
    a(t) = \sum_j c_j(t) A_j\,,
\end{equation}
where $c_j(t)$ captures the entire time dependence. 
Inserting this into the Heisenberg equation of motion and applying an operator scalar product $(A_i|\cdot)$ to both sides of the equation yields
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:heisenberg}
    \begin{aligned}
        \ddt a(t) = \sum_j \ddt c_j(t) A_j &= i \sum_j c_j(t) [H, A_j] \\
        \Rightarrow \sum_j \underbrace{(A_i | A_j)}_{\coloneqq \mN_{ij}} \ddt c_j(t) &= i \sum_j \underbrace{(A_i | [H, A_j])}_{\coloneqq \mM_{ij}} c_j(t) \\
        \Rightarrow \mN \ddt \vec{c}(t) &= i \mM \vec{c}(t)\,.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The matrices $\mN$ and $\mM$ contain all the dynamics and energetic properties of the system.
The former is referred to as a dynamical matrix while the latter is called a norm matrix.
The advantage is that one can now handle simple matrices rather than operators acting on an enormous Hilbert space.
The size of these matrices depends entirely on the set of operators.

However, most Hamiltonians do not allow any such operator set to exist as the commutation usually introduces terms of higher order.
For instance, commuting a bilinear term with a quartic Hamiltonian yields, quartic terms. Repeating the commutation yields hexartic ones and so on.
Therefore, one repeats this commutation process and includes the occurring terms within a bigger set,
hoping to get better results as the set size increases.

In this article, we will be using the operator pseudo scalar product
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:scalar_product}
    (A | B) \coloneqq  \langle [A^\dagger, B] \rangle\,,
\end{equation}
where the expectation values are taken with respect to the thermal equilibrium of the mean-field Hamiltonian \eqref{eqn:mf_hamiltonian}.
Note, that this is not a proper scalar product, as a norm defined using it can also be negative.
For example, assume that for some operator $A$
\begin{equation}
    ||A|| = (A | A) = \langle [A^\dagger, A] \rangle > 0\,,
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
    ||A^\dagger|| = (A^\dagger | A^\dagger) = \langle [A, A^\dagger] \rangle = - ||A|| < 0\,.
\end{equation}
We will compute $\mM$ by commutating with the full Hubbard Hamiltonian \eqref{eqn:full_hamiltonian} enabling us to capture collective behavior rather than the one particle dynamics given by the mean-field approximation.

We create our operator set on the basis of \eqref{eqn:equal_expecs}.
It consists of operators of the type
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:ieom_basis_operator}
    A_\gamma \coloneqq \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vk} \delta (\gamma - \hat{\gamma}( \vk )) A_{\vk}\,,
\end{equation}
where $A_{\vk}$ represents each type of operator in \eqref{eqn:operators} and their Hermitian conjugates.
Operators with different indices are put into the set individually, e.g., $n_{\gamma \up}$, and $n_{\gamma \down}$ are distinct operators in our set.

Naturally, we have to discretize $\gamma$, 
however, this allows us to obtain good results with drastically smaller matrices compared to a momentum-based operator set and obtain results for a three-dimensional system in the first place.
Practically, we choose $N_\gamma = 3000$ equally spaced discretization points.
A detailed explanation of the numerics is provided in the appendix \autoref{sec:numerical_ieom}.

Next, we order these operators in a way reminiscent of the $x$- and $p$-terms in the harmonic oscillator, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
    X_i \coloneqq  A_i + A_i^\dagger\,,\quad P_i \coloneqq  A_i - A_i^\dagger\,.
\end{equation}
Then, our set is given by $\mathcal{B}_{XP} \coloneqq \{ X_i, P_i \}$.
If some operators would be 0 ($P_i$ for any $n$-type term) or duplicates (certain $X_i$ for $g$-type terms), we omit them.

Due to this choice of set, the matrices occurring in \eqref{eqn:heisenberg} have a special block structure
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:xp_set}
    \mM = \begin{pmatrix}
        \mathcal{K}_+ & \kappa \\ \kappa^\dagger & \mathcal{K}_-
    \end{pmatrix}\,,\quad \mN = \begin{pmatrix}
        \Lambda_+ & \mathcal{L} \\ \mathcal{L}^\dagger & \Lambda_-
    \end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{equation}
where the upper block refers to all $X_i$ and the lower block to all $P_i$.
Furthermore, due to symmetry, the relations $\Im [\mathcal{K}_\pm] = \Re [\kappa] = 0$ and $\Re [\Lambda_\pm] = \Im [\mathcal{L}] = 0$ hold.
Thus, if all occurring expectation values are real, both matrices have large empty blocks.
This condition is fulfilled for all cases investigated in this article.
Additionally, the matrix $\mM$ is positive semidefinite if the system is in thermal equilibrium.
We prove this statement in the appendix \autoref{sec:positive_M}.

To study the collective excitations, we investigate various retarded Green's functions 
\begin{equation}
    G_{AB}^\text{ret} (t) = - i \langle [A(t), B] \rangle \Theta(t)\,,
\end{equation}
and their Fourier-transformed
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:standard_gf}
    G_{AB}(\omega + i0^+) = -i \int_0^{\infty} e^{izt} \langle [A(t), B] \rangle \mathrm{d}t\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Theta(t)$ is the Heaviside function.
Our previous choice of pseudo scalar product enables us to write down a matrix-valued Green's functions in terms of the aforementioned matrices
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:green_function}
    \mathcal{G}(z &= \omega + i0^+) = \mN \frac{1}{-z \mN - \mM} \mN \\
        &\coloneqq  -\mN \mathcal{R}(z) \mN\,,
\end{align}
where we used the resolvent
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:resolvent}
    \mathcal{R}(z) \coloneqq  \frac{1}{z \mN + \mM}\,.
\end{equation}
The entries of this matrix $\mathcal{G}(z)$ are the Fourier-transformed Green's functions mentioned in \eqref{eqn:standard_gf} with respect to the operators from the initially chosen set.
For instance, assume the operator in the set is $f_{\vk}$, then the top left element of $\mathcal{G}$ is the Green's function 
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{G}_{00}(z = \omega +i0^+) &=  G_{f_{\vk}(t) f_{\vk}^\dagger} (z) \nonumber \\
        &= -i \int_0^{\infty} \langle [f_{\vk}(t), f_{\vk}^\dagger(0)] \rangle e^{izt} \mathrm{d}t\,.
\end{align}

In the following, we will derive this relation.
For that, consider the Fourier-transformed Green's function \eqref{eqn:standard_gf} with respect to two operators $A$ and $B^\dagger$ that are included in our operator set
\begin{align}
    G_{AB^\dagger} (z) &= - i \int_0^\infty \exp(i z t) \langle [ A(t), B^\dagger(0) ] \rangle \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}
Since $A$ and $B$ are included in the operator set, we can rewrite them as dot products of the vector
\begin{equation}
    \vec{A} \coloneqq  \left( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N \right)\,, \quad
    \vec{A}^\dagger \coloneqq  \begin{pmatrix}
        A_1^\dagger \\ A_2^\dagger \\ \vdots \\ A_N^\dagger
    \end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{equation}
and some other complex-valued vector $\vec{a}$ which has its coefficients set in such a way,
that $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{A}$ is equal to the desired operator. 
For instance, $\vec{a} \equiv \vec{e}_1$ in order to represent $A_1$.

Furthermore, assuming, that $\mN$ is invertible, we can easily solve the differential equation \eqref{eqn:heisenberg} to obtain
\begin{equation}
    \vec{c}(t) = \exp \left( i \mN^{-1} \mM t \right) \vec{c}(0)\,.
\end{equation}
This allows us to finally obtain
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:green_derivation}
    G_{AB^\dagger} (z) &= i \int_0^\infty \exp(izt) \langle [ (\vec{A \cdot} \vec{b}(0))^\dagger, \vec{A} \cdot \vec{a}(t) ] \rangle\ \mathrm{d}t \nonumber \\
        &= i \int_0^\infty \exp(izt) \vec{b}^\dagger(0) \underbrace{\langle [ \vec{A}^\dagger, \vec{A} ] \rangle}_{\equiv \mN} \vec{a}(t) \mathrm{d}t \nonumber \\
        &= i  \int_0^\infty \vec{b}^\dagger(0) \mN \exp \left( i \left(\mN^{-1} \mM + z \right) t \right) \vec{a}(0) \mathrm{d}t  \nonumber \\
        &= - \vec{b}^\dagger(0) \left[ \mN \frac{1}{\mN^{-1} \mM + z} \right] \vec{a}(0) \nonumber \\
        &= - \vec{b}^\dagger(0) \left[ \mN \frac{1}{ \underbrace{\mM + z \mN}}_{\equiv \mathcal{R}(z)} \mN \right] \vec{a}(0)\,,
\end{align}
where $\vec{a}(0)$ and $\vec{b}(0)$ are chosen such, that their product with $\vec{A}$ yields $A(0)$ and $B(0)$, respectively.
The task at hand is finding the resolvent as $\mathcal{R}$.

To do that, we embrace this matrix structure in \eqref{eqn:xp_set} and assume that all matrix entries are real.
Then, with $\mathcal{R}|_X$ denoting the block of a matrix $\mathcal{R}$ corresponding to the $X$-operators, we can calculate
\begin{align}
    r_X (z) &\coloneqq \mathcal{R}(z)|_X = \left. \frac{1}{\mM + z \mN} \right\vert_X \nonumber \\
        &= \left[ \frac{1}{\mM} - \frac{1}{\mM} z \mN \frac{1}{\mM} + \frac{1}{\mM} z \mN \frac{1}{\mM} z \mN \frac{1}{\mM} - \cdots \right]_X \nonumber \\
        &= \left. \frac{1}{\mM} \sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( -z \mN \frac{1}{\mM} \right)^j \right\vert_X \,.
\end{align}
We may omit every second element of the sum, as we want to obtain the upper left block of the matrix, and $\mN$ always swaps the upper left and lower right block.
Thus, we obtain
\begin{align}
    r_X (z) &= \left. \frac{1}{\mM} \sum_{j=0}^\infty z^{2j} \left( \mN \frac{1}{\mM} \right)^{2j} \right\vert_X \nonumber \\
        &= \left. \frac{1}{\mM - z^2 \mN \mM^{-1} \mN} \right\vert_X \nonumber \\
        &= \frac{1}{\mathcal{K}_+ - z^2 \mathcal{L} \mathcal{K}_-^{-1} \mathcal{L}^\dagger}\,.
\end{align}
Next, we define $\check{N} \coloneqq \mathcal{L} \mathcal{K}_-^{-1} \mathcal{L}^\dagger$ for brevity.
Since $\mathcal{M}$ is positive semidefinite and block diagonal, its blocks $\mathcal{K}_\pm$ must be positive semidefinite as well.
Therefore, $\check{N}$ is also positive semidefinite and we can define its square root.
We obtain
\begin{equation}
    r_X (z) = -\check{N}^{-1/2} \frac{1}{z^2 - \check{N}^{-1/2} \mathcal{K}_+ \check{N}^{-1/2}} \check{N}^{-1/2}\,.
\end{equation}
The matrix $\check{M} \coloneqq \check{N}^{-1/2} \mathcal{K}_+ \check{N}^{-1/2}$ is positive semidefinite and Hermitian by the previous arguments.
If $\check{N}$ has a singular part, the inverse can be replaced by the pseudo-inverse.
The same calculation can be repeated by exchanging $X$ with $P$, yielding the relation for the remaining block.
Then, the definitions of the matrices above change in the following way
\begin{equation}
    \check{N}_P \coloneqq \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{K}_+^{-1} \mathcal{L}\,,\quad \check{M}_P \coloneqq \check{N}_P^{-1/2} \mathcal{K}_- \check{N}_P^{-1/2}\,.
\end{equation}
In conclusion, the Green's function is given by
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        G_{AB^\dagger} \vert_P (z) &= - \left[ \vec{b}^\dagger (0) \right]_P \mathcal{L}^\dagger r_X (z) \mathcal{L} \left[ \vec{a}(0) \right]_P\,, \\
        G_{AB^\dagger} \vert_X (z) &= - \left[ \vec{b}^\dagger (0) \right]_X \mathcal{L} r_P (z) \mathcal{L}^\dagger \left[ \vec{a}(0) \right]_X\,.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Now, the task at hand is finding the inverse $1/(z^2 - \check{M})$ for all $z$.
This can be achieved using a Lanczos tridiagonalization and subsequently a continued fraction expansion in the form of

\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
    \left( z^2 - \begin{pmatrix}
        a_0 & b_1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\
        b_1 & a_1 & b_2 & 0 & \cdots \\
        0 & b_2 & a_2 & b_3 & \cdots \\
        0 & 0 & b_3 & a_3 & \cdots \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
    \end{pmatrix} \right)_{00}^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{z^2 - a_0 - \dfrac{b_1^2}{z^2 - a_1 - \dfrac{b_2^2}{ z^2 - a_2 - \hdots}}}\,\,
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}

where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the Lanczos coefficients \cite{PettiforRecursion,ViswanathRecursion}.
Obtaining a diagonal block of $\mathcal{G}$ is easily achieved by setting $\vec{b}(0) = \vec{a}(0)$.
Obtaining an off-diagonal block requires linear combinations in the form of 
\begin{align}
    \vec{a}^\dagger \mathcal{G} \vec{b} &= \frac{1}{4} \Big\{ 
        \underbrace{\left[ (\vec{a} + \vec{b})^\dagger \mathcal{G} (\vec{a} + \vec{b}) - (\vec{a} - \vec{b})^\dagger \mathcal{G} (\vec{a} - \vec{b}) \right]}_{ = 2 \vec{a}^\dagger \mathcal{G} \vec{b} + 2 \vec{b}^\dagger \mathcal{G} \vec{a}} \\
    &-i \underbrace{\left[ (\vec{a} + i \vec{b})^\dagger \mathcal{G} (\vec{a} + i \vec{b}) - (\vec{a} - i \vec{b})^\dagger \mathcal{G} (\vec{a} - i \vec{b}) \right]}_{= 2i \vec{a}^\dagger \mathcal{G} \vec{b} - 2i \vec{b}^\dagger \mathcal{G} \vec{a}} \Big\}\,, \nonumber
\end{align}
i.e., one computes the four diagonal blocks and then simply adds them as described above.

In the single-band case, the coefficients approach the limit
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:inf_lanczos}
    a_\infty = \frac{\omega_+ + \omega_-}{2}\text{  and  } b_\infty = \frac{\omega_+ - \omega_-}{4}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\omega_\pm$ represents the upper and lower band edge, respectively \cite{PettiforRecursion}.
This behavior allows us to terminate the continued fraction, once the coefficients have converged close enough to these values, using the so-called square root terminator
\begin{equation}
    T(\omega) = \frac{1}{2b_\infty^2} \left( \omega - a_\infty \mp \sqrt{(\omega - a_\infty)^2 - 4 b_\infty^2} \right)\,,
\end{equation}
where the negative sign is to be chosen for $\omega - a_\infty > 2b_\infty$ and $|\omega - a_\infty| < 2b_\infty$ and the positive one otherwise.
It is to be noted, that the coefficients start to drop off from this limit as more and more Lanczos iterations are performed \cite{ViswanathRecursion}.
Therefore, we terminate the continued fraction with the aforementioned terminator at the coefficient pair that has the least deviation from $a_\infty$ and $b_\infty$.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

In this section, we will be investigating four different diagonal Green's functions $G_{AA^\dagger}(\omega + i0^+)$, namely with
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eqn:resolvent_bases}
    \begin{align}
        A_\text{Higgs} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vk} \left( f_{\vk} + f_{\vk}^\dagger \right)  
            = \int \dgamma \left( f_{\gamma} + f_{\gamma}^\dagger \right) \,,\\
        A_\text{Phase} &= \frac{i}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vk} \left( f_{\vk} - f_{\vk}^\dagger \right) = \int \dgamma \left( f_{\gamma} - f_{\gamma}^\dagger \right) \,,\\
        A_\text{CDW}   &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vk} \left( g_{\vk \up} + g_{\vk \down} \right) = \int \dgamma \left( g_{\gamma \up} + g_{\gamma \down} \right) \,,\\
        A_\text{AFM}   &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vk} \left( g_{\vk \up} - g_{\vk \down} \right) = \int \dgamma \left( g_{\gamma \up} - g_{\gamma \down} \right) \,,
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $N$ is the number of lattice sites in the system. 
Each one of these operators generates a different kind of collective mode.
The first operator captures the amplitude mode of the $s$-wave superconducting state, while the second one catches the phase mode \cite{Fan22}.
The remaining two capture the collective behavior of the CDW and AFM states, respectively.
In the following, we will refer to the Green's functions generated by these operators as $\mathcal{G}_{i}(\omega) = G_{A_i A_i^\dagger}(\omega)$.

Note, that all of the aforementioned operators are Hermitian. 
This means that all spectral functions need to be completely antisymmetrical, see appendix \autoref{sec:antisymmetry_spectral}.
For this reason, we will only show the $\omega \geq 0$ in our plots. 
Additionally, we will add a small imaginary part of $10^{-5}t$ to $\omega$ in order to visualize the occurring $\delta$ peaks.

\subsection{Classification of the spectral functions}

To begin, let us describe the spectral functions $\mathcal{A}_i (\omega) = - (1/\pi) \Im [\mathcal{G}_i (\omega + i0^+)]$ with respect to the operators above in the various phases.
\autoref{fig:resolvent_overview_SC} shows them at $U = -2.5t$ in the SC ($V=-0.1t$) and CDW ($V=0.1t$ and $V=0.5t$) phase, as well as in the SC-CDW coexistence at $V=0$.

There are a variety of different features. The difference between the two lattices is mostly quantitative.
First and foremost, in the SC phase, see panel (a), there is a sharp peak located at $\omega=0$ in $\spectral{Phase}$ and a singularity in $\spectral{Higgs}$ located at $\omega=2\Delta_\text{SC}$.
We identify them with the well-known Leggett and Higgs modes in superconductors.
The former can be found at zero energy because our model describes a neutral superfluid wherein there is no coupling of the phase of the order parameter to the electromagnetic potential.
Therefore, this phase may be chosen arbitrarily, and changing it requires no energy which ultimately allows a Goldstone mode to exist in the first place. \textcolor{red}{Zitieren!}

To classify the occurring peaks that lie outside the two-particle continuum, we turn toward the real part of the Green's function.
We plot it in close proximity to the peaks with a double logarithmic scale and fit the result linearly $y = ax + b$ to obtain its power-law behavior.
The real part is related to the imaginary part via the Kramers-Kronig relations.
Specifically, if the imaginary part is a $\delta$ distribution, the real part will be proportional to $1/\omega$, i.e., $a=-1$, and the peak has the weight $w_0 = \exp(b)$.
Furthermore, an exponent of $a=-2$ corresponds to the derivative of the $\delta$ distribution, i.e., $\delta'(\omega)$.
The fits themselves can be found in appendix \autoref{sec:fit_greens_functions}.

This analysis provides that the real part of $\greens{Phase}$ near $\omega=0$ behaves as $1/\omega^2$ indicating that the peak in $\spectral{Phase}$ is the derivative of a $\delta$ distribution.
Note, that it is located at $\omega=0$ of a perfectly asymmetrical bosonic spectral function and therefore must have 0 weight.
This is given here, because $\int \delta'(\omega) \mathrm{d}\omega = 0$.

The singularity in $\spectral{Higgs}$ behaves as $1/\sqrt{\omega - 2 \Delta_\text{SC}}$.
Previous studies on the dynamics of the order parameter found damped oscillations after a quench.
These have the frequency $\Omega = 2 \Delta_\text{SC}$ and fall off as $1/\sqrt{t}$ \cite{Yuzbashyan06}.
An inverse Fourier transform of $\spectral{Higgs}$ yields precisely the same behavior, thereby reinforcing the validity of our results.

In the CDW phase, see panels (b) and (c), both of $\spectral{Higgs}$ and $\spectral{Phase}$ become identical and form a $\delta$ peak below the two-particle continuum.
Following the Landau theory for continuous phase transitions, this is to be expected as the free energy is expanded in terms of the order parameter as
\begin{equation}
    f(\Delta_\text{SC}) \approx r |\Delta_\text{SC}|^2 + \frac{u}{2} |\Delta_\text{SC}|^4\,,
\end{equation}
with $r > 0$ and $u > 0$ if the system is outside of the superconducting phase. \textcolor{red}{Zitieren!}
In this case, the only minimum is at $\Delta_\text{SC} = 0$. 
That means that both possible modes have to overcome the same energy to be excited at all. \textcolor{red}{Passt die Beschreibung so?}

In the SC phase, $\spectral{CDW}$ features a $\delta$ peak below the continuum corresponding to the finite energy necessary to excite this kind of electronic density modulation.
For moderate-sized values of $V>0$, i.e., in the CDW phase, see panel (b) at $V=0.1t$, the aforementioned spectral function has a singularity at $\omega=2\Delta_\text{CDW}$.
This mode becomes hard and moves outside the two-particle continuum as $V$ is increased, see panel (c) at $V=0.5t$.

$\spectral{AFM}$ is restricted to the continuum for both phases and both lattices.
For the square lattice, however, there is a singularity located at the upper edge of the two-particle continuum.

    \includegraphics[width=.98\textwidth]{plots/resolvent_overview_V0.pdf}
    \caption{Spectral functions with respect to the operators listed in \eqref{eqn:resolvent_bases}.
    The left column shows the results for the square lattice while the right column shows the results for the simple cubic lattice.
    The left edge of each plot is at $-0.05$ rather than $0$ in order to improve the visibility of the peaks at $\omega=0$.
    The shaded area marks the two-particle continuum.
    For each plot, the parameters are set to $U=-2.5t$, $V=0$, and $N_\gamma = 3000$.
    Since the ratio of $\Delta_\text{SC}$ to $\Delta_\text{CDW}$ may be chosen arbitrarily, we show in (a) the spectral functions for $\Delta_\text{CDW} = 0$ and in (b) for $\Delta_\text{SC} = 0$.}
    \label{fig:resolvent_overview_V0}
\end{figure*}

At $V=0$, both the SC and the CDW phase coexist. 
In this phase, the mean-field single-particle energies are given by
\begin{equation}
    E_{\pm} = \pm \sqrt{\epsilon^2 + |\Delta_\text{CDW}|^2 + |\Delta_\text{SC}|^2}\,.
\end{equation}
This means that the proper order parameter is $\Delta_\text{tot} \coloneqq \sqrt{|\Delta_\text{CDW}|^2 + |\Delta_\text{SC}|^2}$.
Here, $\Delta_\text{CDW}$ and $\Delta_\text{SC}$ can change arbitrarily without affecting the system's energy as long as $\Delta_\text{tot}$ remains constant.
Note that the degeneracy of both phases is exact due to the SO(4) symmetry \cite{yang90}. 

In \autoref{fig:resolvent_overview_V0}, we show the spectral functions for $U=-2.5t$ and $V=0$.
The different panels correspond to different choices for $\Delta_\text{CDW}$ and $\Delta_\text{SC}$.
First, in panel (a), we set $\Delta_\text{CDW} = 0$.
This results in a purely superconducting phase with the same features as in \autoref{fig:resolvent_overview_SC} panel (a).
The peak in $\spectral{CDW}$ moves to a very small, yet finite, $\omega$.

Secondly, panel (b) shows the spectral functions for $\Delta_\text{SC} = 0$, i.e., in a purely charge-ordered phase.
Similar to before, there is not much change compared to \autoref{fig:resolvent_overview_SC} panel (b).
The spectral functions $\spectral{Higgs}$ and $\spectral{Phase}$ are still identical, however, both exhibit a sharp peak at $\omega=0$.
This peak is described by $\delta'(\omega)$.
\textcolor{red}{Warum hat Higgs nun einen Peak bei 0, aber CDW hatte einen bei endlichem $\omega$? Das mÃ¼sste ja bedeuten, dass ein Cooper-Paar energtisch kostenfrei ist, aber ein CDW-Exziton kostet uns etwas Energie.}

Lastly, we chose $\Delta_\text{CDW} = \Delta_\text{SC}$ for panel (c).
Now, $\spectral{Higgs}$ and $\spectral{CDW}$ are identical.
Note, that this only occurs for this specific ratio of $\Delta_\text{CDW}$ and $\Delta_\text{SC}$, otherwise the occurring peaks differ in magnitude.
Both spectral functions have a peak at $\omega = 0$, described by $\delta'(\omega)$, and a singularity at the lower edge of the two-particle continuum $\omega = 2\Delta_\text{tot}$.
\textcolor{red}{TODO: Exponent}

We associate the peak at $\omega=0$ with this shifting of order parameters, i.e., diminishing one and increasing the other while keeping $\Delta_\text{tot}$ constant.
The singularity at the lower edge of the two-particle continuum can be interpreted similarly to the Higgs mode in a pure superconductor.
It captures the change of $\Delta_\text{tot}$ by changing either one of the composing order parameters.

$\spectral{Phase}$ behaves just as it does in the pure SC phase. It has only a peak at $\omega = 0$ that can be associated with the change of the phase of $\Delta_\text{SC}$.

    The left column shows the results for the square lattice while the right column shows the results for the simple cubic lattice.
    The shaded area marks the two-particle continuum.
    For each plot, the parameters are set to $V=1t$ and $N_\gamma = 3000$, while $U$ is varied according to the text in the individual panels.
    The panels (a) and (c) show the spectral functions in the AFM phase, and the panels (b) and (d) in the CDW phase.}
    \label{fig:resolvent_overview_AFM}
\end{figure*}

Lastly, we investigate the same spectral functions close to the AFM-CDW phase transition, depicted in \autoref{fig:resolvent_overview_AFM}.
We choose $V=1t$ for both lattices and $U=zV \pm 0.1t$, where $z$ is the coordination number, see panels (a) and (b).
Again, both SC-related spectral functions are identical in both the CDW and AFM phases.
Within the continuum their weight is shifted towards the upper edge and on the square lattice only, there is a peak above the continuum.
In the AFM phase, both $\spectral{AFM}$ and $\spectral{CDW}$ have a peak close, but yet below, the two-particle continuum.
The peak of the former is at a lower energy than the peak of the latter.
In the CDW phase, this behavior is reversed, i.e., the peak in $\spectral{CDW}$ lies lower.
Using the same analysis as before, we conclude that each of these peaks is a $\delta$ peak.
Moving further away from the phase transition, here $U=z(V+0.2t)$ in panels (c) and (d), the upper peak becomes soft as it shifts into the two-particle continuum. 

\subsection{SC-CDW transition}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.98\textwidth]{plots/sc_peak_in_cdw.pdf}
    \caption{The upper panels show double logarithmic plots of the positions $\omega_0$ of the SC peak in the CDW phases while the lower panels show their respective weights $w_0 = e^{b}$.
    In the upper panel, the pink markers additionally show the peak position divided by the gap $\omega_0 / \Delta_\text{CDW}$.
    The left column shows the results for the square and the right column for the simple cubic lattice at $U=-2.5t$.
    The fits are linear, i.e., $y(V) = c \ln(V/t) + d$, and the parameters are printed on the individual panels.}
    \label{fig:sc_in_cdw_behavior}
\end{figure*}

With the prevalent peaks discussed, we turn towards their behavior as the system approaches the phase transition at $V=0$ for $U=-2.5t$.
First and foremost, we investigate the peak in $\spectral{Phase}$ and $\spectral{Higgs}$ in the CDW phase.
The evolution of its position $\omega_0$ and its weight $w_0$ as $V$ is varied can be viewed double logarithmically in \autoref{fig:sc_in_cdw_behavior}.
For $V \ll t$, the position grows with the square root of $V$. This behavior then transitions to a purely linear growth for large $V$.
Dividing $\omega_0$ by the gap $\Delta_\text{CDW}$ results in a plateau for large $V$ while leaving the square root behavior at the beginning mostly unchanged.

The peak weights $w_0$ fall off as $1/\sqrt{V}$ for $V \ll t$. 
Afterward, it reaches a shallow minimum and rises slightly to reach a constant value.

Specifically, we learn that for $V \ll t$, the peak position follows $\omega_0 = \alpha \sqrt{V}$ and its weight follows $w_0 = \beta / \sqrt{V}$, 
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are some constants.
This allows us to write $w_0 = \beta / (\alpha \omega_0)$. 
Furthermore, we know that the spectral functions need to be perfectly antisymmetrical about $\omega = 0$, i.e., we can observe
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{A}_\text{Phase} (\omega \ll t) &= w_0 (\delta (\omega - \omega_0) - \delta (\omega + \omega_0)) \nonumber \\
        &= - \frac{2\beta}{\alpha} \frac{\delta (\omega + \omega_0) - \delta (\omega - \omega_0)}{2\omega_0} \,.
\end{align} 
Taking the limit of $V \to 0$ corresponds to the limit $\omega_0 \to 0$, i.e., leading to an expression reminiscent of symmetric derivative
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h} = f'(x)\,,
\end{equation}
where the equality holds for any differentiable $f$.
Applying this to our case yields
\begin{align}
    \lim_{\omega_0 \to 0} \mathcal{A}_\text{Phase} (\omega \ll t) = - \frac{2 \beta}{\alpha} \delta'(\omega)\,.
\end{align}
This analysis reinforces our previous identification of the phase peak as $\delta' (\omega)$.

\section{Semipositivity of the dynamical matrix}
\label{sec:positive_M}

We show that $\mathcal{M}$ is positive semidefinite if the system is in thermal equilibrium.
For any $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{C}^N$, consider
\begin{align}
    \vec{x}^\dagger \mM \vec{x} &= \sum_{ij} x_i^* x_j \mM_{ij} \nonumber \\
        &= \langle \left[ \sum_i x_i^* A_i^\dagger, \left[ H, \sum_j x_j A_j \right] \right]  \rangle \nonumber \\
        &= \langle [B^\dagger, [H, B]] \rangle\,,\quad B \coloneqq  \sum_j x_j A_j\,.
\end{align}
For $\mM$ to be positive semidefinite the expression above must not be negative.
Therefore, we need to show, that any diagonal element of $\mM$ is nonnegative.
To do this, we expand the commutators and the thermal expectation value $\langle O \rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \Trace [\exp(-\beta H_\text{MF}) O]$, 
where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $Z$ the partition function.
This procedure yields

\begin{widetext}
    \begin{align}
        \langle [B^\dagger, [H, B]] \rangle &= \frac{1}{Z} \Trace [\exp(-\beta H) [B^\dagger, [H, B]]] \nonumber \\
            &= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_j e^{-\beta \epsilon_j} \bra{\psi_j} [B^\dagger, [H, B]] \ket{\psi_j} \nonumber \\
            &= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_j e^{-\beta \epsilon_j} \left[ \bra{\psi_j} B^\dagger (H - \epsilon_j) B \ket{\psi_j} + \bra{\psi_j} B (H - \epsilon_j) B^\dagger \ket{\psi_j} \right] \nonumber \\
            &= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{ij} e^{-\beta \epsilon_j} \left[ \bra{\psi_j} B^\dagger \ket{\psi_i} (\epsilon_i - \epsilon_j) \bra{\psi_i} B \ket{\psi_j} + \bra{\psi_j} B \ket{\psi_i} (\epsilon_i - \epsilon_j) \bra{\psi_i} B^\dagger \ket{\psi_j} \right] \nonumber \\
            &= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{ij} e^{-\beta \epsilon_j} (\epsilon_i - \epsilon_j) \underbrace{ \left[ \bra{\psi_j} B^\dagger \ket{\psi_i} \bra{\psi_i} B \ket{\psi_j} + \bra{\psi_j} B \ket{\psi_i} \bra{\psi_i} B^\dagger \ket{\psi_j} \right]}_{\coloneqq C_{ij} = C_{ji} \geq 0} \nonumber \\
            &= \frac{1}{2Z} \left[ \sum_{ij} C_{ij} e^{-\beta \epsilon_j} (\epsilon_i - \epsilon_j) - \sum_{ij} C_{ij} e^{-\beta \epsilon_i} (\epsilon_i - \epsilon_j) \right] \nonumber \\
            &= \frac{1}{2Z} \sum_{ij} C_{ij} \left( e^{-\beta \epsilon_j} - e^{-\beta \epsilon_i} \right) \left( \epsilon_i - \epsilon_j \right) \geq 0 \,.
    \end{align}
\end{widetext}

This concludes our proof. Note, that the only assumption made, is that the expectation is to be taken with respect to the thermal equilibrium.

In this appendix section, we show fits to the real and imaginary parts of various Green's functions in the different phases.
All fits are linear of the type $y = ax + b$ in double logarithmic plots, i.e., $a$ describes the power-law behavior of the functions.
Firstly, the real part of $\greens{Phase}$ in the SC phase is shown in panel (a) of \autoref{fig:zero_peaks}.
It behaves as $1/\omega^2$ indicating that the peak we find in the spectral function at $\omega=0$ corresponds to the derivative of a $\delta$ distribution.
The same results are obtained for the peak in $\spectral{Higgs}$ and $\spectral{CDW}$ in the coexistence phase.

Continuing, we investigate the divergence at $\omega = 2\Delta$ found in $\spectral{Higgs}$ within the SC phase.
It behaves as $1/\sqrt{\omega}$ as shown in \autoref{fig:higgs_peak}.

Lastly, we show all the remaining peaks in \autoref{fig:peak_fits}.
The real part of each one of them behaves as $1/\omega$ in close vicinity to the peak position.
This indicates that the peaks are $\delta$ distributions.
The peaks of $\spectral{AFM}$ and $\spectral{CDW}$ close the the phase transition are identical when swapped, i.e., $\spectral{AFM}$ in the CDW phase is the same as $\spectral{CDW}$ in the AFM phase.

\section{Numerical treatment of the iEoM matrices}
\label{sec:numerical_ieom}

We would like to use operators like \eqref{eqn:ieom_basis_operator} to span our operator set.
However, numerically, it is impossible to matrices with infinite dimensions, requiring us to discretize.
Additionally, we cannot numerically write down $\delta$ distributions as matrix elements. Therefore, we need some special treatments, which we will describe in this section.
We discretize the $\gamma$-space equally with each abscissa $\gamma_i$ being spaced by $\Delta \gamma$.
Then, we define an approximate $\delta$ function
\begin{equation}
    h(\gamma) \coloneqq \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{\Delta \gamma} & |\gamma| < \frac{\Delta \gamma}{2} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\,.
\end{equation}
Computing an integral yields
\begin{equation}
    \int f(\tilde{\gamma}) h(\tilde{\gamma} - \gamma_j) \mathrm{d} \tilde{\gamma} \approx \sum_i f(\gamma_i) h(\gamma_i - \gamma_j) \Delta \gamma = f(\gamma_j)\,,
\end{equation}
showing that $h(\gamma)$ mimicks the continuous $\delta$ distribution for a discrete description.
Note, that if one takes the limit $\Delta \gamma \to 0$ the $\delta$ distribution is exactly reproduced.

Numerically, we can compute the matrix elements like this
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:numerical_example}
    (A_i | A_j) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\vk \vl} h(\gamma_i - \hat{\gamma}(\vk)) h(\gamma_j - \hat{\gamma}(\vl)) (A_{\vk} | A_{\vl})\,.
\end{equation}
Here, all expressions are finite numbers and do not require further treatment.
Mutatis mutandis, one obtains a similar expression for $(A_i | [H, A_j])$.
Additionally, note, that the expressions $(A_{\vk} | A_{\vl})$ and $(A_{\vk} | [H, A_{\vl}])$ can be reduced to sums of terms that are proportional to $\gamma_i$ or $\gamma_j$, respectively.
Therefore, it is not necessary to implement any sort of momentum space computations.
For example, consider $A_{\vk} = f_{\vk}^\dagger$, then
\begin{equation}
    ( f_{\vk}^\dagger | f_{\vl}^\dagger ) = \delta_{\vk, \vl}\, \langle 1 - n_{\vk \uparrow} - n_{\vk \downarrow} \rangle \eqqcolon \delta_{\vk, \vl}\, \alpha(\vk)
\end{equation}
holds. Inserting this into \eqref{eqn:numerical_example} yields
\begin{equation}
    (A_i | A_j) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\vk} h(\gamma_i - \hat{\gamma}(\vk)) h(\gamma_j - \hat{\gamma}(\vk)) \alpha(\vk)\,.
\end{equation}
As stated in the main text, see \eqref{eqn:equal_expecs}, $\alpha(\vk)$ depends only on $\hat{\gamma}(\vk)$, hence we can switch from the momentum sum to a $\gamma$ integration
\begin{align}
    (A_i | A_j) &= \int \rho(\gamma) h(\gamma_i - \gamma) h(\gamma_j - \gamma) \alpha(\gamma) \dgamma \nonumber \\
        &\approx \rho(\gamma_i) h(\gamma_j - \gamma_i) \alpha(\gamma_i) \nonumber \\
        &= \frac{\delta_{ij}}{\Delta \gamma} \rho(\gamma_i) \alpha(\gamma_i)\,.
\end{align}
Since $\Delta \gamma$ is a positive constant factor, it does not impact any of our matrix operations, i.e., we can pull it out to the front of the expressions $\mM \to \tilde{m} (\Delta \gamma)^2$ and $\mN \to \tilde{n} (\Delta \gamma)^2$.
Then, we can rewrite \eqref{eqn:green_derivation} as
\begin{equation}
    G_{AB^\dagger}(z) = - (\Delta \gamma)^2 \vec{b}^\dagger (0) \left[ \tilde{n} \frac{1}{\tilde{m} + z \tilde{n}} \tilde{n} \right] \vec{a}(0)\,.
\end{equation}
To give a practical example, let us compute $\greens{Higgs}$ from \eqref{eqn:resolvent_bases}.
We order our operator set such that all $f_\gamma + f_\gamma^{\dagger}$ are upfront. 
This requires the vector elements $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ to be
\begin{equation}
    a_i = b_i = \begin{cases}
        1 & i < N_\gamma \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\,,
\end{equation}
where $N_\gamma$ is the number of discretization points.
Using this, we can expand the relation for the Green's function
\begin{align}
    \greens{Higgs} (z) &= -(\Delta \gamma)^2 \sum_{i=0}^{N_\gamma} \sum_{j=0}^{N_\gamma} \left[ \tilde{n} \frac{1}{\tilde{m} + z \tilde{n}} \tilde{n} \right]_{ij} \nonumber \\
        &\approx - \int \dgamma \int \dgamma' \left[ \tilde{n} \frac{1}{\tilde{m} + z \tilde{n}} \tilde{n} \right](\gamma, \gamma')\,.
\end{align}
The first line is an approximation of the integral in the second line, as each matrix element corresponds to a specific value for $\gamma$.

\section{Antisymmetry of the spectral functions}
\label{sec:antisymmetry_spectral}

Consider any Hermitian operator $A$. 
We compute the Fourier-transformed Green's function for positive and negative $\omega$
\begin{align}
    G_{AA}(\omega) &= -i \int_0^\infty e^{i \omega t} \langle [A(t), A] \rangle \mathrm{d}t\,, \nonumber \\
    G_{AA}(- \omega) &= -i \int_0^\infty e^{-i \omega t} \langle [A(t), A] \rangle \mathrm{d}t\,.
\end{align}
We also compute the complex conjugate of the former
\begin{align}
    G_{AA}^* (\omega) &= i \int_0^\infty e^{-i \omega t} \langle [A(t), A] \rangle^* \mathrm{d}t \nonumber \\
        &= i \int_0^\infty e^{-i \omega t} \langle [A^\dagger, A^\dagger(t)] \rangle \\
        &= -i \int_0^\infty e^{-i \omega t} \langle [A(t), A] \rangle \\
        &= G_{AA}(- \omega)
\end{align}
Taking the imaginary part reveals
\begin{align}
    \Im [ G_{AA}^* (\omega) ] = - \Im [G_{AA} (\omega) ] = \Im [G_{AA} (-\omega)]\,.
\end{align}
This proves that the imaginary part of such a Fourier-transformed Green's function is antisymmetrical and therefore the same applies to the spectral functions.
Note that this fully abides by the sum rule $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathcal{A}_{A^\dagger A} (\omega) \mathrm{d}\omega = \langle [A^\dagger, A] \rangle = 0$ \cite{rickayzen80}.
