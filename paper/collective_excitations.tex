\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

The Hubbard model at half-filling has been employed in a plethora of previous studies. 
Early studies proved the existence of eigenstates to the Hubbard Hamiltonian that exhibit off-diagonal long-range order, tantalizing the model's usage for the description of high-temperature superconductivity \cite{yang89}.
Shortly afterward, an exact $SO(4)$ symmetry was discovered, which allows a degeneracy of a superconductivity (SC) and a charge-density wave (CDW) with an attractive on-site interaction \cite{yang90}.
There exists a particle-hole transformation on bipartite lattices, that maps the attractive Hubbard model exactly onto the repulsive one, exhibiting antiferromagnetism (AFM).
The previously mentioned SC and CDW phases map to different spin operators \cite{zitko15,lieb89}.
\newline
Many recent experimental and theoretical studies examined the driven systems in the hope of inducing superconductivity \cite{Nicoletti14,Casandruc15,patel16,sentef17,Buenemann17}.
Other studies focusing on equilibrium systems investigated phases including various additional interaction with and without doping 



\section{Methods}\label{sec3}

\section{Results}\label{sec2}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.

\section{Section title of first appendix}\label{secA1}

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential part of the text itself but 
which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.
